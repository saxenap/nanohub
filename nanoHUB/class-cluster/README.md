# class-cluster Guide

### Naming Breakdown

* clustering_V0: original version of Mike and Xufeng's clustering algorithm
  * mi_cl_V0: original script of Mike's algorithm
  * xu_cl_V0: original script of Xufeng's algorithm
  * README.md: detailed breakdown of files inside this V0 repository
* clustering_V1: algorithm speedup is done, added a script to summarize semester numbers
* clustering_V2: combine clusters that share the same class id in Xufeng's algorithm
* visualization_V0: not working, original version of cluster visualization by Mike Zentner
* visualization_V1: fixed version of visualization_V0
* visualization_V2: replace raindrop labels from geolocation to institution name 
* mike_V0_clust_files: original inputs and outputs of Mike's visualization
  * mi_V0_2008fall_vi.png: original raindrop plot for 2008fall semester
  * mi_V0_2008fall_vi_seq.txt: the text file contains all users plotted in the raindrop, in the same sequence
  * user_geolocation_nathan.csv: matches a single user between 2007-2013 to a location, generated by Nathan Denny
* mike_V1_clust_files: output cluster file from Mike's clustering and raindrop plots from visualization
  * mi_dets_V1.csv: detailed csv contains semester, number of clusters, cluster id, users in each cluster, unique institutions, institution list from Mike's clustering version 1
  * mi_inst_V1.csv: csv contains semester, institution name, clusters per institution
  * mi_sum_V1.csv: csv contains semester, number of clusters, total users, total institutions
  * for example: 2007fall: the folder contains cluster file, raindrop plot, raindrop text file, summary table for that single semester
    * mi_V1_2007f_cl.csv: cluster file from Mike's clustering version 1
    * mi_V1_2007f_vi.png: raindrop plotted by cluster file from Mike's clustering version 1
    * mi_V1_2007f_vi_seq.txt: the text file contains all users plotted in the raindrop, in the same sequence
    * mi_V1_sum_2007f.xlsx: the excel sheet contains dets, inst, sum, for that semester
* xufeng_V1_clust_files: output cluster file from Xufeng's clustering and raindrop plots from visualization
