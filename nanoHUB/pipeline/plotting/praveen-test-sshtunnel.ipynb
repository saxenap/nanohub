It allows a client to browse a remote filesystem, usually with a graphical browser that makes it appear that your files are on your desktop.  You may access your hub storage using only the secure version of this service (HTTPS).  We do not support HTTP.  Most modern computer platforms support HTTPS transport for WebDAV with either small adjustments or freely available software.</p>\\n\\t<h3>Linux/Unix</h3>\\n\\t<p>If you use the KDE graphical desktop environment, you can access your hub storage with the Konqueror browser by typing the special URL <tt>webdavs://HUBADDRESS/webdav</tt> into the Location field of the browser.  It will prompt you for your hub login and password.  Thereafter, you traverse your home directory by clicking on folders and you can drag and drop files to your desktop.<br />\\n<a href=\\\\\"http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"external\\\\\">Cadaver</a> is a text-mode WebDAV browser.  It can be used if it is compiled with SSL support.  Invoke it with the command <tt>cadaver https://HUBADDRESS/webdav</tt> and it will prompt you for your hub login and password.  You can then use it in a manner similar to FTP.<br />\\nIf you are using Linux, you can use the <a href=\\\\\"http://dav.sourceforge.net/\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"external\\\\\">davfs</a> kernel module to mount your hub storage area as a local filesystem.</p>\\n\\t<h3>Macintosh</h3>\\n\\t<p>MacOS versions 10.4 and higher support HTTPS transport for WebDAV using the Finder.  To access your hub directory, select the Go menu in the Finder and choose \\\\\"Connect to Network Server\\\\\".  Enter the URL <tt>https://HUBADDRESS/webdav</tt> into the address field.  You will be prompted for your hub login and password.<br />\\nMacOS versions lower than 10.4 do not have support for HTTPS, but a free client exists.  Download <a href=\\\\\"http://www.webdav.org/goliath/\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"external\\\\\">Goliath</a> and install it on your system.  Invoke it and use <tt>https://HUBADDRESS/webdav</tt> as the address to connect to.  Note that you may also use Goliath on newer MacOS platforms as well.</p>\\n\\t<h3>Windows</h3>\\n\\t<p>Windows XP systems have native support for accessing WebDAV storage via HTTPS, but it may be disabled by default depending on how your OS was configured.  Try these instructions first, and then check the next set of instructions to enable WebDAV.  To access your hub storage,</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li> Double-click on the desktop icon called \\\\\"My Network Places\\\\\".</li>\\n\\t<li> This will invoke a dialog box where you can select \\\\\"Add Network Place\\\\\".

An icon will be created for the hub storage folder.  When you double-click on it to open it, you will be prompted for your hub login and password.</li>\\n\\t</ul>\\n\\t<h4>Enabling WebDAV in Windows XP</h4>\\n\\t<p>If the steps above do not work, for Windows XP, or you cannot find the named options, your OS may have WebDAV turned off by default.

       "\\n<p>Trolls are people who are just being rude and obnoxious, and are generally trying to offend, shock, harass, abuse or otherwise annoy people. Dealing with such people can often be difficult, but they should not go unwarned or unremoved. Trolls can destroy a community, and often this is their goal.</p>\r",
       "\\n<p>Trolls thrive on attention, and often the best way to deal with them is to completely ignore them. They don\\\\'t know when they are being ignored, all they know is that no one is responding to their attempts to annoy, harass or offend.</p>\r",
