We are developing novel methods for linking human whole genome variation with human disease and trait variation. We apply these methods to multiple datasets in the contexts of prematurity, autism, heart disease and more [20, 29, 32, 34, 36, 38, 39, 43].

2. Genotype - Phenotype relationships between mammals.
We develop novel methods to link trait evolution in the mammalian tree to whole genome evolution in over a hundred species. Application of these methods allow us to shed new light on human genome function, on human disease and on human evolution [29, 34, 35]. See our ""Forward Genomics"" web server.

3. Extracting genetic knowledge from high throughput genomic assays.
High throughput genomic assays are most often used to make biochemical discoveries. We develop methods to extract genetic and developmental knowledge from these assays [27, 28, 31]. Through joint work with Sue McConnell we take special interest in the developing neocortex [29, 41]. Also see our popular GREAT web server for the cis-regulatory interpretation of high throughput genomic datasets.

4. Vertebrate transcription regulation.
Much of our work relies on our strong foundations in the study of vertebrate gene regulation [9-11, 14, 15, 18, 22, 25, 27, 29-33, 35, 38-42]. See our PRISM resource of predicted transcription factor functions and COMPLEX resource for predicted transcription factor dimers and complexes. Also see our zCNE resource of conserved non-coding (likely gene regulatory) sequences in the zebrafish genome.

5. Vertebrate genome evolution.
We are extremely well versed in human and vertebrate genome evolution [9-11, 14, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26, 29, 33-35, 37, 39, 40]. Notably, we discovered ultraconservation and correctly postulated that many of these elements are developmental enhancers. We also showed that mammalian ultraconserved elements evolve under extreme purifying selection, and that they are almost never lost during mammalian evolution [9, 23, 25]. We also discovered the first developmental enhancers conserved between human and protostomes [33], attempted to group human conserved non-coding DNA into paralog families [10], and studied the co-option of mobile elements into cis-regulatory roles [18, 22, 26, 41].

6. Evolutionary Developmental Biology (""evo devo"").
We have done work in the field of evolutionary developmental biology [29, 33-35, 43], including a first survey of developmental enhancers (including a penile spine/vibrissae enhancer) uniquely lost in humans [29], fueled by our deep interest in phenotype - genotype relationships.",,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the pervasiveness of these fluid-suspended, microscopically small particles (colloids), many of their behaviors have defied explanation – such as the sudden collapse of colloidal gels, vitrification that thwarts crystallization, and their physical role in biological cell function. In addition to these opportunities, the frontier of cellular biology resides at the colloidal scale, requiring a merger between physics and biology, which have evolved almost orthogonally since the 19th century. My lab focuses on unifying mesoscale physics and chemistry with cellular-level biology through novel theoretical modeling and large-scale computational simulations. Our work includes four areas: 1) constructing a micro-continuum theory of complex fluids to predict heterogenous flows of arbitrary composition; 2) mechanistically explaining non-equilibrium phase transitions in colloidal systems; 3) modeling confined and large-scale hydrodynamically-interacting colloidal suspensions; and 4) modeling the physics of living cells.

Redox-active materials promise the efficient transformation between electrical, chemical, and thermal energy, and are at the heart of carbon-neutral energy cycles. Understanding design rules that govern materials chemistry and architecture holds the key towards rationally optimizing technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers, and novel thermodynamic cycles. Electrochemical and chemical reactions involved in these technologies span diverse length and time scales, ranging from Ångströms to meters and from picoseconds to years. As such, establishing a unified, predictive framework has been a major challenge. The central question unifying our research is: “can we understand and engineer redox reactions at the levels of electrons, ions, molecules, particles and devices using a bottom-up approach?” Our approach integrates novel synthesis, fabrication, characterization, modeling and analytics to understand molecular pathways and interfacial structure, and to bridge fundamentals to energy storage and conversion technologies by establishing new design rules.",,,,,,,,,,,

 A new Nafion membrane micromorphology has been generated by uniaxially stretching and then annealing a gelled (10% solvent content)cast film. The proton conductivity of uniaxially pre-stretched recast Nafion (0.1 S/cm at 25oC for membranes in water) was independent of draw ratio, whereas the methanol permeability decreased by a factor of 1.4-2.0, as compared to commercial Nafion, for films elongated to a draw ratio of 4. A pre-stretched recast Nafion film in the 130-180 ?m thickness range, when used in a direct methanol fuel cell, generated a high power density at 0.4 V (88 mW/cm2 at 60oC, 1.0 M methanol, and ambient pressure air), as compared to 58 mW/cm2 for Nafion 117. Very high power was generated with pre-stretched recast Nafion (180 ?m) by increasing the cell temperature to 80oC, increasing the anode/cathode catalyst loading to 8.0 mg/cm2, and increasing the cathode air pressure to 25 psig. Under these conditions the power density at 0.4 V for a 1.0 M methanol feed solution was 240 mW/cm2 and the maximum power density was 252 mW/cm2 (at 0.35 V).",,,,,,,,,,,

This multidisciplinary nature of multiscale materials modeling endows students working on these projects with a broad knowledge base across many scientific disciplines. We develop efficient computational techniques to implement these materials models, taking advantage of large-scale parallel computing capabilities. At every possible scale, our simulations are benchmarked against and validated with experimental data to build confidence in the models.

The research focuses on molecular synthesis and nanofabrication for the development of new polymers and nanostructures with desired electronic, photonic, and/or mechanical properties. The applications of these materials are many folds, including flexible electronics, artificial muscles, photovoltaics, wind energy generation, radiation detection and protection, and biologically-inspired systems to name a few. Current activities include:
 
 Artificial Muscles: These are based on dielectric elastomers exhibiting electrically-induced strains as high as 300%. The polymer transducers have such advantages as high energy and power densities, quietness, mechanical compliancy (for shock resistance and impedance matching), high efficiency, lightweight, and low cost. To improve the device performance and reliability, interpenetrating polymer networks are being studied as a new generation of electroelastomers. Fault tolerance is being introduced as a means to prolong operation lifetime. Our projects involve mechanical design, fabrication, and testing of polymer actuators and generators. Bistable electroactive polymer has been introduced for large-strain, rigid-to-rigid actuation. This material is being employed to fabricate Braille electronic readers.
 
 Flexible electronics: We are developing electronic devices that are flexible and stretchable. A key component is stretchable transparent electrodes based on composites of carbon nanotubes and silver nanowires. The composites electrodes have sheet resistance and transmission of visible light comparable to indium tin oxide coated on PET and glass. Polymer light emitting diodes and solar cells fabricated on the composite electrodes perform as well as or better than control devices on ITO/glass. Using the composite electrodes, we have demonstrated polymer LEDs wherein the active area is stretchable.
 
 Nanostructured hybrid materials: Composites of inorganic compounds and conjugated polymers are prepared with controlled nanostructures for photovoltaics or radiation detection. We synthesized CdS nanorod arrays by electrochemical self-assembly, and CdS thin coating by chemical bath deposition. High-Z nanoparticle polymer composites are studied for gamma and X-ray scintillation.
 
 Synthesis of conjugated polymers: The band gap, band edges (electron affinity and ionization potential), optical absorption, photoluminescence color and quantum efficiency, and carrier mobility can be modulated through the conjugated backbone or side chains, structural regularity, molecular weight, purity, and molecular ordering. We can thus tailor conjugated polymers for different applications such as light emitting diodes, solar cells, thin film transistors, and sensors.

   Our research projects focus on the relationship between structural and chemical irregularities in solid state electronic materials and the effect that these defects have on the performance of devices fabricated from these materials. Our research often involves collaboration with industrial and government laboratories to provide a synergistic effort to study these issues. In particular, we use non-destructive techniques to study the behavior of defects in these structures.
   Our primary efforts in materials integration include:
 
   Electrical and thermal transport across epitaxial and bonded heterojunctions. We have pioneered techniques to produce low resistance interfaces and this approach has been utilized by other to produce world-record solar cell efficiencies.
   Thermocompression bonding of Cu-Cu and Au-Au terminated later structures through fundamental studies of the roles of surface morphology, compressive force, temperature, and phase transformations. This approach enables Heterogeneous Integration and Performance Scaling by integrating small dielets onto an engineered substrate at pitches comparable to on-chip wiring levels.
   Thermal transport across dissimilar materials such as diamond-GaN interfaces and engineering these interfaces to reduce thermal barrier resistance through analysis of the nano-scale chemical and structural properties of the interfaces.
 
 
   Wide bandgap materials can be used to produce devices that outperform commercial devices by operating at higher voltages, temperatures and frequencies. These devices will have significant impact in the areas consumer electronics, the electricity grid, power supplies, solar and wind power, automotive, ship propulsion, and aerospace. We are addressing ion implantation for selective dopant activation, epitaxial regrowth, and bonding GaN to other materials to provide a path to high performance.
   Porous semiconductors represent an underutilized class of materials – we are exploiting porous semiconductors in the areas of epitaxial liftoff and layer transfer and targeted drug delivery vehicles for medical applications.
   Advanced characterization techniques are utilized in collaborations to produce unique and high performance materials structures for solar cells and flexible substrates.

 Of late, we concentrate on composite materials and aluminum alloys, using acoustic emission and related ultrasonic methods. In particular, we examine techniques to predict incipient fracture with advanced acoustic emission analysis, relying on digital signal acquisition and pattern recognition processing.
 
 Acoustic emission (AE) has demonstrated capabilities for monitoring structural integrity and for dynamically characterizing materials behavior. Fatigue fracture in aluminum alloys and micro-fracture processes in fiber reinforced composites generate numerous acoustic emission (AE) signals that can be detected. With proper analysis, these AE signals can dynamically identify failure processes. However, conventional AE methods with the use of event counts, event energy, signal amplitude, duration and rise time, etc. have severe limitation in the characterization of AE sources. For fatigue detection and for failure mechanism study in composite materials, advanced characterization methods are needed. By using sensor output waveforms, identifying unknown signals and evaluating their significance, and correlating identified signals to the failure modes, the advanced methods permit quantitative interpretations based on signal feature analysis and identify the nature of emission sources. The techniques of pattern recognition are used to classify unknown signals into groups, which are related to specific signal characteristics.",,,,,,,,,,,

Current work in her group is aimed at understanding and controlling structure and periodicity in complex nanostructured composite materials, and in exploiting that periodicity for a range of structural, optical, and electronic materials applications. Projects in Prof. Tolbert's group range from examination of nanoscale phase transitions in surfactant templated inorganic solids to the designed assembly of electro-active composite materials.

 Research in my group focuses around two intertwined goals. These are first, to create complex materials with nanoscale periodicity using self-organization, and second, to produce new physical properties because of that nanoscale architecture. The specific properties vary dramatically from project to project and include control of optical, magnetic, electrical, and even structural behavior. In all cases, however, the goal is to intrinsically tie the physical properties to the nanoscale structure, and in so doing, to understand the new dimension of control that size and spatial confinement can bring.
 
 In my group, we use two main methods to produce nanoperiodic structures. Colloidal assembly is a simple method of producing periodic structures with virtually any length scale. Monodisperse colloids of almost any size can spontaneously order into close-packed arrays. Because of this size flexibility, colloidal assembly is the method of choice for producing larger-scale photonic materials with periodicity on the order of the wavelength of light. A structurally more versatile method for producing smaller-scale periodicity is inorganic/organic co-assembly. In this approach, amphiphilic organic surfactants or block co-polymers are co-assembled with inorganic oligomers to produce periodic inorganic/organic composites or nanoporous inorganics with periodicities similar to those found in lyotropic liquid crystalline phases.

 Benjamin Wu, D.D.S., Ph.D., is a practicing clinician and biomaterial scientist. His research brings to bear bioengineering approaches to regenerate lost tissues based on the following biomimetic strategy: (i) learn from natural developmental biology, wound healing, and tissue remodeling; (ii) copy nature and engineer biomimetic microenvironments to promote tissue repair; and (iii) investigate the mechanisms by which progenitor cells and biomolecules interact with engineered microenvironments, which can be formed with a combination of surface bound and/or diffusible biochemical signals and/or biomechanical signals. The projects summarized below demonstrate the application of this general strategy to solve significant clinical problems.
 
 1) Bone Repair with Biomimetic Apatites
 
 This project mimics the natural formation of a thin layer of biological apatites around certain foreign implant materials during bone healing. These apatites are distinct from commercially available, synthetic hydroxyapatites with regard to composition and properties. Prof. Wu’s team has developed a rapid materials processing strategy to confer uniform, biocompatible apatite coatings throughout the pores of complex three dimensional scaffolds. By controlling microstructure, his group has extended the classic structure-processing-property-performance paradigm by demonstrating that the distinct apatite microenvironments derived from various processing routes can yield significantly different cellular expression of mature osteoblastic genes. His team recently reported in Nature Biotechnology that this microenvironment alone, without the addition of expensive and specific biochemicals, is sufficient to stimulate adipose-derived and marrow-derived progenitor cells to differentiate into bone-forming cells and restore large, critical-size bony defects. This novel finding has motivated intense efforts to establish the molecular understanding of the effects of changes in microenvironment on cell fate. Specifically, Prof. Wu is currently focused on the identification of the dominant signaling pathways by which these biomimetic apatites affect progenitor cells in order to establish molecular-based design criteria for creating even better materials in the future.
 
 2) Bone Repair with Bioinspired Growth Factors
 
 This project mimics the expression of a human growth factor, UCB, that is naturally expressed at the osteogenic front of a premature cranial suture fusion associated with craniosynostosis. Unlike bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP’s) which signal non-specifically upstream of core-binding factor Cbfa1/Runx2 and are responsible for numerous clinical complications in human cervical spinal fusion, UCB appears to signal downstream of Cbfa1/Runx2 and may therefore potentially yield fewer complications. Prof. Wu’s team has identified this growth factor, and has effectively delivered this protein. Specifically, complete healing of large, critical sized defects in various animal models have been achieved by selecting the proper carrier-protein combination while simultaneously providing the mechanical and chemical requirements for the carrier to meet the needs of the given biological environment. Prof. Wu’s team is currently investigating the electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interactions that operate between UCB and the microenvironment. In addition, his team is also developing osteogenic microenvironments that work synergistically with UCB to reduce the dosage of UCB by at least four orders of magnitude.

 This project mimics and accelerates the simultaneous formation of a natural blood clot, initiation of a foreign body reaction, and formation of granulation tissues around non-degradable platinum coils within un-ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Prof. Wu’s team hypothesized that such tissue formation can be greatly accelerated by creating a local microenvironment that is initially, and only transiently, pro-inflammatory. Prof. Wu’s team demonstrated that delivery of a biodegradable coil comprised of a transiently pro-inflammatory polymer can indeed accelerate tissue formation, and subsequently, tissue shrinkage after coil degradation. Observing that dense granulation tissues tend to form around the coils, Prof. Wu has developed a novel processing technique to incorporate chemically immiscible components to produce oriented microfilaments, and therefore, maximize the surface area available for dense granulation tissue formation. Moreover, the cell-surface interactions within the aneurysm will also be enhanced by incorporating additional pro-inflammatory agents in the material. The ultimate application of this approach is to expand the clinical indication and overall success rate of intracranial aneurysm management using degradable coils.
 
 4) Engineering of Intestinal Tissues
 
 This project mimics the intestinal microenvironment by engineering (i) an epithelial intestinal villae layer with high surface area for efficient mass transfer and (ii) a functional smooth muscle layer that provides intestinal contractility. Prof. Wu’s team has developed a novel computer-driven fabrication approach to produce high resolution, microporous villae-like structures that are adhesive for epithelial cells, and patented the conditions to differentiate human adipose derived stem cells into the smooth muscle lineage. The overall goal of the project is to establish the design rules to control the three dimensional spatial positioning of the appropriate biochemical cues to simultaneously manage the adhesion, differentiation, and function of multiple cell types for the purpose of engineering intestinal tissues.
 
 5) Biomechanical Stimulation of Ligaments
 
 This project mimics the non-static microenvironment during biomechanical stimulation of natural tissues and the resultant effects on cellular adaptation and extracellular matrix synthesis. Although the precise signaling mechanism underlying mechanotransduction is not completely understood, there is little doubt that mechanical stimulation plays a significant role in ligament formation. The literature clearly shows that exercise results in ligament hypertrophy, increased ligament strength and stiffness, and increased attachment strength at the ligament-bone junction, while immobilization results in atrophy. Prof. Wu’s team has constructed a computer-driven, customized bioreactor that controls strain amplitude, frequency, strain rate, and duty cycle, and has reported that early adaptation of cells to the 3D microenvironment is significantly enhanced by the addition of biomechanical stimulation. Prof. Wu’s laboratory is currently identifying the optimal combination of biochemical components (i.e. surface modification and growth factor delivery) that will work synergistically to significantly enhance the cell response to biomechanical stimulation. In this manner, we hope to better understand the effects of biochemical stimulation on ligament formation.
 
 6) Biomineralization with Biomimetic Peptides
 
 This project mimics the natural biomineralization process in which selected amino acids of proteins induce nucleation and growth of biominerals. The objective of this project is to promote tooth remineralization by creating a surface microenvironment that is favorable to nucleation, growth, and stability of natural biominerals. Simultaneously, Prof. Wu’s team is also developing peptide libraries with controlled electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interactions to investigate biomaterial-protein/peptide interactions, which can be used in the future to modify surfaces. Note that this peptide-based strategy is also being investigated for the biomimetic apatite project described earlier.
 
 As clearly reflected by the above-mentioned project areas, Prof. Wu’s biomimetic research program is highly interdisciplinary. Therefore, in addition to contributing to the tissue engineering field with his cutting-edge research, his training program produces graduates with a unique set of skills that are beneficial to this area in academia as well as industry.",,,,https://weintraubcenter.dentistry.ucla.edu/wu-lab,,,,,,,

 The influence of internal and applied stress on the morphology, spatial correlations and kinetics of coarsening of Ni3X-type precipitates in binary Ni-X alloys (X = Al, Ga, Ge, Si or Ti) are currently under investigation. The role of volume fraction is being explored using special “up-quenching” aging treatments to overcome problems with natural fluctuations in concentration attendant to alloy preparation by ingot metallurgy. Experiments using novel tapered specimens will be examined to obtain data for the first time on the kinetics of coarsening under stress. This research program makes heavy use of transmission electron microscopy, to measure precipitate sizes and size distributions, and magnetic analysis to measure solute concentration in the matrix during coarsening. New apparatus is being developed to enable continous monitoring of solute concentration during the coarsening of solid and liquid “droplets” in a liquid metal matrix.

 Our research efforts are directed towards the development and design of sustainable low-CO­2 foot-print materials for infrastructure construction applications. These efforts are three-fold encompassing:
 
   strategies to utilize natural and waste materials in concrete by inferring optimal chemical combination’s and compatibilities of constituent materials using thermodynamic calculations and experimental evaluations,
   the formulation and-or utilization of application specific organic and inorganic chemicals to improve the properties, durability performance and service-life of concrete structures and
   developing CO2-insensitive concretes for use in carbon sequestration and fixation applications.
 
 To this end, our research group develops fundamental constituent chemistry-microstructure-engineering performance descriptors of cementitious materials to correlate and unify the fundamental variables that describe the overall response of the material. These efforts are directed towards the addressing the practical needs of the wider construction community and developing “new concretes” for the next generation of infrastructure construction applications. The overall theme of research aims to rationalize the use of natural resources in construction, promote environmental protection and to advance the cause of ecological responsibility in the concrete construction industry.

The applications of these materials are many folds, including flexible electronics, artificial muscles, photovoltaics, wind energy generation, radiation detection and protection, and biologically-inspired systems to name a few. Current activities include:
 
 Artificial Muscles: These are based on dielectric elastomers exhibiting electrically-induced strains as high as 300%. The polymer transducers have such advantages as high energy and power densities, quietness, mechanical compliancy (for shock resistance and impedance matching), high efficiency, lightweight, and low cost. To improve the device performance and reliability, interpenetrating polymer networks are being studied as a new generation of electroelastomers. Fault tolerance is being introduced as a means to prolong operation lifetime. Our projects involve mechanical design, fabrication, and testing of polymer actuators and generators. Bistable electroactive polymer has been introduced for large-strain, rigid-to-rigid actuation. This material is being employed to fabricate Braille electronic readers.
 
 Flexible electronics: We are developing electronic devices that are flexible and stretchable. A key component is stretchable transparent electrodes based on composites of carbon nanotubes and silver nanowires. The composites electrodes have sheet resistance and transmission of visible light comparable to indium tin oxide coated on PET and glass. Polymer light emitting diodes and solar cells fabricated on the composite electrodes perform as well as or better than control devices on ITO/glass. Using the composite electrodes, we have demonstrated polymer LEDs wherein the active area is stretchable.
 
 Nanostructured hybrid materials: Composites of inorganic compounds and conjugated polymers are prepared with controlled nanostructures for photovoltaics or radiation detection. We synthesized CdS nanorod arrays by electrochemical self-assembly, and CdS thin coating by chemical bath deposition. High-Z nanoparticle polymer composites are studied for gamma and X-ray scintillation.
 
 Synthesis of conjugated polymers: The band gap, band edges (electron affinity and ionization potential), optical absorption, photoluminescence color and quantum efficiency, and carrier mobility can be modulated through the conjugated backbone or side chains, structural regularity, molecular weight, purity, and molecular ordering. We can thus tailor conjugated polymers for different applications such as light emitting diodes, solar cells, thin film transistors, and sensors.

,berkeley.edu,Ting Xu,tingxu@berkeley.edu,,,,,"Future technologies depend on the development of functional material having 1) hierarchical structures spanning multi-length scale down to the molecular level; 2) built-in functionalities, such as biological, optical, electronic, magnetic property; 3) superior selectivity with sensitivity comparable to what found in nature and 4) responsiveness to the external stimuli. These require one to select the right building blocks, understand the principles underpinning the self-assembly, and use these principles to direct the assemblies at various length scales to obtain targeted functional materials. More importantly, we need to develop a versatile methodology to generate new functional materials simply by substituting building blocks, instead of re-building them from scratch. Numerous building blocks have been explored to achieve this end and obtaining functional materials to meet these requirements remains a significant challenge to the soft material community.
 
 Our group focuses on generating hierarchical functional soft materials using synthetic polymers, peptides and proteins, small organic molecules and nanoparticles as building blocks. Each offers unique properties and is complimentary to each other. Natural proteins have complexities in terms of structure and functionaly unmatched by synthetic materials. De novo designed peptides are minimalistic natural proteins that mimic natural protein functionalities but are subject to degradation. Small organic molecules, especially those with optical, electronic and magnetic properties, can be readily synthesized with molecular control to provide built-in functionalities. Nanoparticles, due to their size, exhibit unique properties not seen in macroscopic materials and constitute essential building blocks in the fabrication of nanodevices. It is non-trivial to obtain macroscopic assemblies of either small molecule or nanoparticle at low cost. Polymers with different architectures can be synthesized and are amenable to various processing techniques. Developments in polymer sciences provide guidance to manipulate their assemblies at different length scales. However, generating molecular level assemblies with designer functionalities using polymers alone is challenging. Synergistic assemblies of these selected building blocks clearly have tremendous potential to construct technologically important functional materials. By developing fundamental understanding of the physics of assemblage, our group aims to generate hierarchical structures spanning multi-length scales down to few nanometers with built-in biological, electrical and magnetic functionalities. Currently, our group is engaged in three major research activities to address the challenge of multi-length scale, hierarchical functional assemblies using these building blocks.",,,,,,,,,,,

 Graphene Growth on Metal Foils
 
 The understanding of graphene growth on metal substrates is far from complete, yet it has significant consequences for the final film properties. We use low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) to characterize in-situ graphene growth on metal substrates. By measuring the growth velocity as a function of the carbon adatom concentration, we gain insight into the fundamental processes that control graphene growth. Epitaxial graphene growth on metal substrates is unique in that the film lies a few angstroms above the metal substrate but the edges are bonded to the substrate more strongly than the interior. We investigate the consequences of this strong edge binding for the growth process, including its effects on growth velocity, island morphology, and island impingement.",,,,,,,,,,,
